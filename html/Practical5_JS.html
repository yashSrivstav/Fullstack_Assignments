        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g.,
            having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side
            versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply
            downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
            programmatic control over them. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and
            Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
